# Single Player ModPack (Mistlands edition)

*WARNING: do not update to 2.x unless you want to start a new game!!! games started under 1.x might behave weird with the new changes...*

This is my selection of mods that I want to use for doing single player play through. 
These mods do help on (in vanilla still really annoying) daily tedious tasks, you will not loose equipment 
on death and adds loot and more challenging monster difficulty.

Credits of the mods used in this pack go all to the original mod authors, thx to all for providing these to us.

## Game changes and guidance

Starting from version 2.x.x I introduced different requirements for progression: you will have to kill monsters to raise the sector level of the current area you are in to yield better loot. Better loot will be required for fighting the bosses, do not try fighting those without gearing up, you might be facing too difficult bosses!

## Features

Note: I moved a lot of mods used indirectly to the other modpack https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/SimplePlaystyleEnchancements/ -> check there for more detailed description of features.

* Base building and handling simplified by larger workbench ranges, ward range, ward making buildings indestructible
* Container handling with auto storing, restocking, trashing, etc.
* Crafting will get less tedious, no wait time, multi crafting possible
* Craft and build from boxes, no need to pick and drop things into your inventory anymore
* Farming improved too mass farm "shift"
* Auto picking up items as you walk along, no need to press "E" that many times
* Exploration radius increased and acts on visibility conditions (weather, height)
* Set of extra skills to train that yield better resource and 
* Production tooling improved with bigger smelter, etc. storage and faster outputs
* Create levels and abilities set to "very hard" and challenging game play
* Enchanted loot and enchant mats drop from creates with higher levels
* Forsaken power used passively instead of active
* Equipment and quick slots
* Any portal targeting instead of point-to-point connections
* ... many more, you will find out ;)

## Hints 

* You can also use this modpack to do coop playing, but if you will join any server using this, it might not work ;)
* You can toggle auto-picking items with "P + right shift"

## Change log
