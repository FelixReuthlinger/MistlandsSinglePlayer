# Single Player ModPack (Mistlands edition)

This is my selection of mods that I want to use for doing single player play through. 
These mods do help on (in vanilla still really annoying) daily tedious tasks, you will not loose equipment 
on death and adds loot and more challenging monster difficulty.

Credits of the mods used in this pack go all to the original mod authors, thx to all for providing these to us.

## Features

* Base building and handling simplified by larger workbench ranges, ward range, ward making buildings indestructible
* Container handling with auto storing, restocking, trashing, etc.
* Crafting will get less tedious, no wait time, multi crafting possible
* Craft and build from boxes, no need to pick and drop things into your inventory anymore
* Farming improved too mass farm "shift"
* Auto picking up items as you walk along, no need to press "E" that many times
* Exploration radius increased and acts on visibility conditions (weather, height)
* Set of extra skills to train that yield better resource and 
* Production tooling improved with bigger smelter, etc. storage and faster outputs
* Create levels and abilities set to "very hard" and challenging game play
* Enchanted loot and enchant mats drop from creates with higher levels
* Forsaken power used passively instead of active
* Equipment and quick slots
* Any portal targeting instead of point-to-point connections
* ... many more, you will find out ;)

## Config changes

* DeathTweaks -> keep equipment and quick slots on death, reduce skill loss to 1%
* AAA Crafting -> remove the paginator and set crafting speed to 0 (instant craft on click)
* Area Repair -> 30m radius
* Workbench tweaks -> workbench and base size ranges to 50m, extension to 20m
* Better Wards -> buildings indestructible and range to 50m, turned off notifiers
* Deezy Mistballs -> radius 50m 
* Auto Picker -> don't pick Dandelions
* Path Finder -> reduced discovery radius to something that looks similar to the range one can see dependent on conditions
* Auto Map Pins -> some that I sense to be valuable I did set to be shown
* Crafty Boxes -> range to 50m
* Extended Inventory -> added 2 rows to default inventory (Auto Store seems buggy with last row tho)
* Conversion size and speed -> increased the storage and throughput
* CLLC -> set to "very hard" and world age, activated all extras, etc. -> I die a lot, so you will, or not? ;)
* Extra skills -> experience increased and yield increased
* Epic Loot -> set to 50% items and 50% mats
* EAQS -> changed keys to "c,v,b"

## Hints 

* You can also use this modpack to do coop playing, but if you will join any server using this, it might not work ;)
* You can toggle auto-picking items with "P + right shift"
